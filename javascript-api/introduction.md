# Introduction

Our Javascript API is the bridge between your web application and the underlying ToDesktop app. You can use it to access features which are available to desktop apps but not web apps.

When your web app is running as a desktop app with ToDesktop, we expose a `window.todesktop` object.

The features provided through this are fairly minimal at the moment but we are constantly adding to them.
