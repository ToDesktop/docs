# ðŸ–² Menubar Icon

For the menubar icon on Mac you can use a "Template image". These are special images that should consist of a black and an alpha channel only. These types of images can adapt to both light and dark menu bars.

{% hint style="info" %}
To mark an image as a template image, just upload a file that ends with the word Template. For example:  
`xxxTemplate.png`
{% endhint %}
